# Greatest Common Factor Function

## Background

The greatest common factor, or GCF, is the greatest factor that divides two numbers. The Euclidean Algorithm is a technique to find the Greatest Common Factor of two integers.

## Directions
Complete the given template file lab15.cpp by defining a function named gcf that accepts the two integer inputs as A and B. The function calculates the greatest common value 
for the two values using a recursive call to the gcf function which returns the greatest common factor once it is found.

## Interface Prototype Example

### Test Case 1 Output
<pre><b>Enter two integer values you want to find the GCF for: 121 1023

The greatest common factor of 121 and 1023 is 11</b></pre>
### Test Case 2 Output
<pre><b> Enter two integer values you want to find the GCF of: 1071 462

 The greatest common factor of 1071 and 462 is 21</b></pre>
